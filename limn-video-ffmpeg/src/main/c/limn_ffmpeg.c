/*
 * limn_ffmpeg.c: the only C in this repository, and the only thing that talks to libavcodec.
 *
 * It is a PLAYER HANDLE, not a binding. Nothing here mirrors the codec API: Java never sees an
 * AVFrame, an AVPacket, an AVCodecContext or a pointer to any of them. It sees a handle, a slot
 * index and a picture's geometry, which is what keeps this file small enough to review and keeps
 * every lifetime question on this side of the boundary where it can be answered.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * WHO OWNS THE PICTURE MEMORY, AND FOR HOW LONG
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * libavcodec owns it. It hands out reference-counted pictures from a pool of its own, and a
 * picture stays alive exactly as long as some AVFrame holds a reference to it.
 *
 * This file keeps `slotCount` AVFrames (the slots), and each is either FREE (this side's, empty)
 * or BUSY (referenced by a picture Java is holding). The two lifetimes are tied together in
 * exactly one place, and this is it:
 *
 *     readVideo()      acquires a free slot, decodes into it, marks it BUSY.  ref taken
 *     releaseVideo()   av_frame_unref()s that slot and marks it FREE.         ref dropped
 *
 * `releaseVideo` is reached from exactly one place in Java (the VideoFrame.Recycler the pool
 * installs), so `VideoFrame.release()` and `av_frame_unref()` are the same event seen from two
 * sides. Nothing else unrefs a busy slot, and a slot that is BUSY is never touched by the decoder.
 * There is no path on which a picture is freed while Java can still read it, and none on which a
 * picture outlives the handle: closeHandle() unrefs every slot, free or busy, and after it Java
 * holds only a VideoFrame that answers `false` to being held.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * WHEN THE CONSUMER HOLDS EVERY SLOT
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * readVideo returns READ_PENDING. It does not block, does not wait on a condition, and does not
 * copy the picture somewhere else to free the slot. A consumer that holds every slot is told to
 * release one and ask again, which is what VideoStreamSource.Read.PENDING means.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * WHAT CROSSES PER PICTURE, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN ALLOCATION
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * One call, filling a `long[]` the caller allocated once: the presentation time, a binding epoch
 * and the three row strides. Nothing is created: no AVFrame wrapper, no ByteBuffer, no String.
 *
 * The planes themselves are direct ByteBuffers over libavcodec's own memory (NewDirectByteBuffer
 * over AVFrame.data[i]), which is the no-copy path: FFmpeg's data[]+linesize[] is already
 * planes-plus-byte-strides, the exact shape the SPI publishes, so nothing is repacked.
 *
 * Those ByteBuffers cannot be made once at startup, because a decoded picture lands on whichever
 * buffer libavcodec's pool had free, so the address a slot carries changes from picture to
 * picture. They are therefore cached BY ADDRESS in `bufferCache` and shared across slots. The set
 * of distinct addresses a decoder uses is bounded by its own pool, so the cache fills during the
 * first few pictures and is all hits afterwards, which is what makes steady-state decoding
 * allocation-free, and what AllocationProbe in the test suite is pointed at.
 *
 * `epoch` is how Java knows whether to rebind. It changes only when this slot's planes moved, so
 * Java calls VideoFrame.Writer.setPlane during warm-up and never again, which matters because
 * setPlane creates a read-only view, i.e. it allocates.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * EVERY PATH A MALFORMED INPUT CAN TAKE
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * A native decoder that segfaults kills the JVM, and CrashPhase.DECODE contains a Java exception,
 * not a signal. So every input-derived quantity is checked here before it is used, and each check
 * below throws rather than dereferences:
 *
 *   open   - avformat_open_input fails                    -> throw (not a container, or unreadable)
 *          - avformat_find_stream_info fails              -> throw
 *          - no video stream                              -> throw
 *          - a codec libavcodec was not built with        -> throw, naming it
 *          - avcodec_open2 fails                          -> throw
 *          - a pixel format outside PixelFormat           -> throw, naming it
 *          - width/height outside [1..MAX_DIMENSION]      -> throw (a header can claim anything)
 *   read   - avcodec_send_packet / receive_frame error    -> throw with av_strerror's text
 *          - frame geometry differs from the header's     -> throw (the SPI fixes it at open)
 *          - a negative linesize (bottom-up rows)         -> throw; the SPI forbids them
 *          - a linesize below the plane's byte width      -> throw
 *          - data[i] == NULL for a plane of the format    -> throw
 *   audio  - a sample format this file cannot convert     -> throw, naming it
 *          - a channel count of zero                      -> throw
 *
 * Nothing here trusts a field because a well-formed file would have set it. Where a check is
 * cheap and the failure is a dereference, the check is present.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * THE THREAD CONTRACT
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * Four threads reach a handle, and they are not the same thread:
 *
 *   the player's decode thread   readVideo, resetVideo          serialized by MediaPlayer
 *   any thread                   releaseVideo                   VideoFrame.release, per its
 *                                                               contract, on whichever thread
 *   the engine's streaming thread readAudio, resetAudio         serialized by the audio engine
 *   the UI thread                closeHandle, releaseAudio      after the decode thread is joined
 *
 * So this file DOES lock, and the claim that a serialized decode thread needs none is true only
 * of the video path in isolation. Three mutexes rather than one, because one would put a whole
 * video decode in front of every audio refill:
 *
 *   demuxLock  the AVFormatContext and both packet queues
 *   videoLock  the video codec context, the slots, the buffer cache
 *   audioLock  the audio codec context and its partially drained frame
 *
 * LOCK ORDER: videoLock or audioLock may be held while taking demuxLock. demuxLock is never held
 * while taking either. videoLock and audioLock are never held at the same time. That is the whole
 * rule, and it is why there is no cycle to deadlock on.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * HOW TWO TRACKS ARE PULLED WITHOUT ONE STARVING THE OTHER
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * There is one demux loop and two consumers running at different rates on different threads.
 * Whichever thread needs a packet runs the loop under demuxLock; packets for the other track are
 * pushed onto that track's queue and picked up when its own thread asks. So neither track waits
 * for the other to be pulled, and neither thread owns the demuxer.
 *
 * What bounds the queue that nobody is draining: QUEUE_MAX_PACKETS and QUEUE_MAX_BYTES. A file
 * whose tracks are interleaved the way a muxer interleaves them never approaches either; the
 * bound is reached only when a consumer has genuinely stopped, which happens for real reasons (a
 * paused player, an audio engine that refused the track, a view that was detached).
 *
 * At the bound the OLDEST packet of the full queue is dropped and counted, rather than the
 * demuxing thread blocking. Blocking is the alternative and it is worse in both directions: a
 * stalled video consumer would stop the soundtrack, and AudioStreamSource.readFrames has no way
 * to say "not now" (its zero means end of stream), so an audio thread made to wait would either
 * hang the engine or lie about the track ending. Dropping is visible (droppedVideo/droppedAudio
 * are readable and asserted in the tests) and self-correcting: the consumer that resumes gets
 * recent data rather than a backlog.
 *
 * A track with no consumer at all is cheaper still: `audioClaimed` is cleared when the audio side
 * is released, and its packets are then freed as they are demuxed rather than queued.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * SEVERAL AUDIO TRACKS, AND WHY ONLY ONE OF THEM IS OPEN
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * A container may hold any number of audio streams. This file records every one of their indices
 * at open and OPENS EXACTLY ONE: av_find_best_stream's answer by default, or whichever
 * selectAudio was told to take. Everything downstream of the selection stays singular: one codec,
 * one partially drained frame, one queue, one downmix.
 *
 * That is a decision and not an omission. N open decoders would be N codec contexts, N queues and
 * N downmix matrices to keep coherent across a seek, for a capability no consumer has: the audio
 * engine mixes one source per player, so a second decoded track is samples nobody reads.
 *
 * The demux filter follows the selection rather than the media type. A packet belonging to an
 * audio stream that is not the selected one is FREED as it is met, exactly as an unclaimed track's
 * is, which is the property that keeps a film's five unread language tracks from growing memory
 * for the length of the film.
 *
 * WHAT A SELECTION DOES TO THE CONSUMER THAT HAD THE OLD TRACK is the whole of the difficulty, so
 * it is a number: `audioGeneration` is bumped by every selection, and every audio entry point
 * takes the generation its caller was handed. A call from a superseded consumer is ANSWERED, not
 * punished: readAudio gives 0, which is what the end of a track means to the engine, and seek,
 * reset and release do nothing. The engine's streaming thread can genuinely be inside a refill
 * when the user interface picks another language, and the alternative to answering it is either a
 * lock held across a whole decode or a use-after-free.
 *
 * The stale RELEASE is the one that would be silent. `releaseAudio` clears `audioClaimed`, and the
 * engine closes a source it was given on every path, so a superseded track closing after the new
 * one was selected would unclaim the track somebody is listening to, and the sound would stop with
 * nothing anywhere reporting a fault. That is why the generation is checked there too.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ the clip writer */

/*
 * Writes a real MP4 holding a real encoded video track and, optionally, a real AAC track.
 *
 * It exists because nothing this build can generate is committed, so the only honest way to test
 * a demuxer is to produce something for it to demux. The same entry point
 * is what the Kitchen Sink uses to make the clip it plays.
 *
 * It cannot encode H.264, because FFmpeg's H.264 encoder is x264 and x264 is GPL. What that costs
 * is stated plainly: this round trip proves the SEAM (the demuxer, the packet-to-frame path, the
 * planar handoff, the pool, the release discipline and the timestamp rescale), and it does not
 * prove libavcodec's H.264 decoder, which is FFmpeg's to test and is covered by FFmpeg's suite.
 *
 * TWO CODECS, because they exercise different halves of the decode path:
 *
 *   codecId 0, MJPEG          Intra-only, no reordering and no decoder delay. Nearly lossless at
 *                             the quality used, which is what lets the sample assertions be tight.
 *                             This is the one to reach for by default.
 *   codecId 1, MPEG-4 Part 2  An inter-frame codec with a real group of pictures, which is the
 *                             SHAPE H.264 has even though it is not H.264: pictures that need
 *                             their predecessors, and a decoder that carries state across packets.
 *
 * Both deliver exactly as many pictures as were written, and a test may assert that count for
 * either. Note for anyone who changes the muxing below: that is a property of setting each
 * packet's duration, not something the codecs give for free.
 *
 * The picture is deliberately flat colour bars rather than a gradient or noise: a lossy encoder
 * moves every sample, so an assertion can only be about an area's mean, and large flat areas are
 * what make that tight enough to catch a swapped chroma pair or a plane read at the wrong stride.
 *
 * In the shipped `player` build there is no encoder at all and avcodec_find_encoder returns NULL,
 * so this throws instead of writing. That is the whole difference between the two builds.
 *
 * SEVERAL AUDIO TRACKS, because selecting between tracks cannot be tested against a file that has
 * one. Each gets a language tag of its own and a tone of its own (440 Hz times an odd multiple per
 * track, doubled per channel), so a test that asked for track 1 and is hearing track 0 sees it as a
 * frequency and not as a subtle difference in level. Track 0 channel 0 is 440 Hz exactly as it was
 * before there could be a track 1, which is what keeps the existing sample assertions meaning what
 * they meant.
 *
 * SUBTITLE TRACKS follow the same rule and add one of their own. Each cue's text NAMES its track
 * and its own index ("T0 C3"), so a reader that has the wrong track, or a cue from where the film
 * used to be, sees which rather than having to infer it from timing. The cues are CONTIGUOUS: cue i
 * covers pictures [10i, 10i+10), with no gaps between them. That is not tidiness, it is what makes
 * the seek assertion sharp: at every instant of the clip exactly one cue is on screen and its text
 * says where in the film it belongs, so "a scrub left a stale cue up" is a wrong string and not a
 * judgement about an interval.
 *
 * The first cue of every track carries ASS override tags and a hard line break, and the rest do
 * not. That is what makes the markup rule testable in both directions from one file: cue 0 asserts
 * that the tags were removed and that \N became a newline, and cue 1 asserts that stripping does
 * not damage a line that never had any.
