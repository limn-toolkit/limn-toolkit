# Builds the trimmed FFmpeg that limn-video-ffmpeg loads, and the JNI shim in front of it.
#
# One output is committed and the rest are not: native/dist/player is what a published jar ships,
# so it is in git and a clone carries a working decoder for the platforms already built. Every
# other profile, and every intermediate, is gitignored. A machine with no build for its own
# platform still builds and tests the whole repository; the decoder reports itself unavailable
# and its tests skip.

#   ./scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh --clean          # discard the unpacked source and every output
#
# WHY TWO PROFILES
#
#   `player` is what ships: it decodes the codecs listed below out of MP4 and Matroska/WebM and can
#   do nothing else. It holds no encoder, because an encoder is not merely bytes: MPEG-4 Visual
#   and AVC are licensed separately for encode and for decode, so shipping one buys patent surface
#   for a capability a player does not use.
#
#   `full` adds the mpeg4 and aac encoders, the mpeg4 decoder and the mov muxer, so a test can
#   write a real MP4 and read it back. No GENERATED media is committed, so the honest way to test
#   the writer is to run it; the committed corpus in media/ is the other half, the codecs nothing
#   here can encode (docs/adr/027). Both profiles compile the SAME shim from the
#   SAME source: the writer entry point is always present and asks libavcodec at run time whether
#   an encoder exists, so `player` differs from `full` by which codecs are linked in and by
#   nothing else.
#
# WHICH CODECS, AND WHY AV1 IS NOT ONE OF THEM
#
#   Video: h264, hevc, vp9, vp8.  Audio: aac, opus, vorbis.  Containers: mov (mp4/m4v/3gp) and
#   matroska (mkv/webm).  Each of those was measured on its own before it was added, because a
#   codec nobody can weigh is a codec nobody can refuse. See docs/adr/015.
#
#   AV1 IS ABSENT AND IT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. FFmpeg's own "av1" decoder is a hardware-accelerator
#   wrapper with no software path at all: libavcodec/av1dec.c refuses outright when no hwaccel is
#   attached, and --disable-everything switches every hwaccel off. Software AV1 needs libdav1d,
#   which is an EXTERNAL library: another pinned tarball, a meson/ninja toolchain, a cross build
#   per architecture and its own payload. That is a phase, not a flag, so adding --enable-decoder=av1
#   here would produce a build that claims AV1 and fails on the first file.
#
# LICENCE
#
#   --enable-gpl is absent and must stay absent. FFmpeg is LGPL-2.1-or-later until a GPL
#   component is switched on, and every GPL component (libpostproc, three x86 optimisation files,
#   a list of filters, the build/test tools) is off here. The libraries are built SHARED and the
#   shim links them dynamically, which is what FFmpeg's own compliance guidance asks for and what
#   keeps the relink obligation off anything downstream. See docs/adr/011.
#
#   Do not add --enable-gpl, --enable-nonfree, --enable-libx264 or --enable-libx265 to make
#   something work. LicenceTest asserts the built library still reports LGPL and still refuses
#   every protocol but file:, and it fails the build if this line drifts.

#                                                handed to it as a "path". --disable-network makes

#                                                they are string manipulation over shared ASS
#                                                helpers, so they are three orders of magnitude
#                                                below every other row in ADR 015 §2. No bitmap
#                                                decoder is here and none is wanted: PGS and
#                                                VobSub are pictures, and this SPI carries text
#                                                cues only, so such a track is refused by name.
#   --disable-autodetect                         Nothing is picked up from the build machine, so
#                                                two machines produce the same library. Without it
#                                                a macOS build silently acquires VideoToolbox and
#                                                a Linux one acquires whatever -dev packages
#                                                happen to be installed.
#
# swscale and avfilter are absent because nothing needs them: planar YCbCr goes to the GPU as it
# comes out of the decoder (ADR 007), and the planar-float-to-interleaved-16-bit step the audio
# track needs is arithmetic the shim does itself.
#
# libswresample IS present, and not because the shim uses it; it still does that arithmetic
# itself. FFmpeg's native Opus decoder declares a dependency on swresample, so without it configure
# switches the Opus decoder off and says so only in a warning line of its log. Since most WebM
# audio is Opus, a Matroska demuxer without it would open the file and play it silent. Measured at
# 0.18 MB for the pair, which is the whole reason it is here rather than a principle.

# glibc symbol it uses, the loader refuses the library when the running glibc is older, and nothing
# about the build says so. It happened here. A first Linux build made on a Fedora 44 guest linked,
# staged, passed its tests on that guest and required GLIBC_2.43, a glibc released weeks earlier.

# Debian 12, not RHEL 9. The tests that prove the decoder works prove it on the build machine, and
# that is exactly the evidence this failure does not disturb.
#
# So the build machine's glibc is the thing being checked, and the fix is to build somewhere old
# rather than to relax the number. A container image with an old glibc is the ordinary way; the

This artifact contains unmodified binaries of FFmpeg ${FFMPEG_VERSION}, built from the upstream
release tarball by scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh in the Limn UI repository.

FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later. The full
text is in LICENSE-ffmpeg.txt beside this file. FFmpeg's own copyright and authors are in the
source release; nothing here modifies it.

The build deliberately omits --enable-gpl and --enable-nonfree, so no GPL or non-redistributable
component is present. It is configured with --disable-everything and switches back on only the
demuxers, decoders and parsers this toolkit opens.

The libraries are built SHARED and loaded dynamically by liblimnffmpeg, which is Limn's own code
under Apache-2.0. Replacing libavutil, libswresample, libavcodec and libavformat in this
directory with a different build of the same soname is supported and requires nothing to be
recompiled; that is how the relink freedom LGPL-2.1 section 6 protects is satisfied here.

# DELIBERATELY NOT lipo'd into universal binaries.
#
# It was, briefly, and it was the wrong shape: the loader picks a directory from os.arch, so a
# universal library has to be copied into BOTH directories to be found, which puts every byte of
# both architectures in the jar twice, four times the size of the one slice any given JVM will
# load. A fat binary earns its keep in a single-file app bundle, not in a classifier layout that
# already selects by architecture.
#
# So each architecture keeps its own thin build in its own directory. One jar carrying both is the
# sum of the two; a per-classifier jar is just one of them, and needs no change here or in the
# loader: the resource path is already <os>-<arch>.
